thus for the machines code
**Javascript is a high level language**

the executional context

there two types of executional context
there is the global one and the local one
the local one gets created when a function is created
and gets distroyed when we remove the function from the memory

//THE CALL STACK
THe call stack keeps track of our codes and runs the codes
THe global context is always assumed to be at the button of the callstack
Current running functions are always at the top of the stack
When functions get added

# CLOSURES

Closures helps to store functions to prevent them from rerunning and saving memory

# PROMISES
